- 👋 Hi, I’m @ArepaZombie
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and working in game design, software development and web design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code in Python and Java. Besides I'm also learning the basics from web design
- I'm also making little games to explore the different functions in the technologies I'm learning. Info in [this blog](https://arepazombie.github.io/arepas-blog/)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... idk, I'm just learning, but maybe videogames and projects that helps other people to learn
